## Load & Explore Data

-   Reads `student_scores.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
-   Plots a graph of **Hours studied vs. Scores** to visualize the
    relationship.
-   Checks for missing values.

## Data Preparation

-   Splits the dataset into **features (Hours)** and **labels
    (Scores)**.
-   Reshapes arrays to be suitable for model training.
-   Divides data into **training** and **test sets**.

## Linear Regression

-   Trains a Linear Regression model to predict student scores from
    study hours.
-   Evaluates the model using **R² score** on both training and test
    sets.
-   Visualizes the regression line for training and test data.

## Polynomial Regression (advanced)

-   Builds a Polynomial Regression model to capture non-linear
    relationships.
-   Fits and compares results with Linear Regression.
-   Plots curves to show model performance.
